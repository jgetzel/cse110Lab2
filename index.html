  <p>I haven't learned <span class="hotmail">HTML</span> before, so this is going to be my first shot at this.

    <h2>Today's topic: <i><span class="hotmail">HTML</span></i></h2>
    HTML is a hot new tool that all the kids are using! Users include:
    <ol>
      <li><b>Successful software developers</b> who, through a combination of luck, determination, and by god the
        most unholy amount of gumption, managed to break into the industry.
      </li>
      <li><b>Middle school children</b> who's teachers put them on CodeAcademy for an hour.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And that's the complete list.</p>

    <h3>What exactly does HTML stand for?</h3>
    <p>Many people, even some very well studied people, have somehow come to the conclusion
      that HTML stands for <strong>"Hypertext Markup Language"</strong>.</p>

      <p>These people don't know what they're talking about.</p>
