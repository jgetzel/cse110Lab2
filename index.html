    <p>I haven't learned <span class="hotmail">HTML</span> before, so this is going to be my first shot at this.
      <em>Just putting that out there.</em>

        <p>HTML is a hot new tool that the whole industry just started using! Users include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Successful software developers</b> who, through a combination of luck, determination, and by god the
            most unholy amount of gumption, managed to break into the industry.
          </li>
          <li><b>Middle school children</b> who's teachers, for one hour, put them on CodeAcademy.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>And that's the complete list.</p>

        <h3>What exactly does HTML stand for?</h3>
        <p>Many people, even some very well studied people, have somehow come to the conclusion
          that HTML stands for <strong>"Hypertext Markup Language"</strong>, and think that is what websites are made
          of.</p>

        <p>These people don't know what they're talking about.</p>

        <section>
          <p>HTML is actually short for <b><i>Hotmail</i></b>, which started off as a digital mailing service ran on
            some poorly ventilated computers,
            hence the name. People would send eachother digital mail, which we now call "digi-Letters", which would
            sometimes
            contain websites. Ever since people stopped using Hotmail, HTML has been used to refer to the inner workings
            of a website.</p>

          <aside>
            <p>However, much like the water that runs through our rivers, the earth beneath our feat, and the air that
              we breathe, no one really knows what websites are made of.
            </p>
          </aside>

          <p>And another thing that bothers me; Hypertext Markup <i>"Language"?</i> To remind those of us at home, a
            language is something
            that you speak. With your mouth. <br><br> We'll let go of the fact that the first two words are complete gibberish,
            but as far as I'm aware, nobody speaks "Hypertext Markup" to their friends. I think you'd find yourself out
            of luck if you tried to
            find me a country where it is common
            for one person to say to the other, <code>"&#60p&#62 Hey, fine weather we're having! &#60\p&#62"</code></p>

        <h3>How do you know so much about HTML, Jakob?</h3>

        <p>
          Pure gumption, that's how. Also, look at what I can do.

          An intelligent person like you must be asking yourself, <i>"who is HTML Services LLC, and if no one made HTML as it is 
            simply a timeless universal presence, what do they do?"
          </i>
