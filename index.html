  <p>I haven't learned <span class="hotmail">HTML</span> before, so this is going to be my first shot at this.
    <em>Just putting that out there.</em></p>

    <h2>Today's topic: <i><span class="hotmail">HTML</span></i></h2>
    HTML is a hot new tool that the whole industry just started using! Users include:
    <ol>
      <li><b>Successful software developers</b> who, through a combination of luck, determination, and by god the
        most unholy amount of gumption, managed to break into the industry.
      </li>
      <li><b>Middle school children</b> who's teachers, for one hour, put them on CodeAcademy.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And that's the complete list.</p>

    <h3>What exactly does HTML stand for?</h3>
    <p>Many people, even some very well studied people, have somehow come to the conclusion
      that HTML stands for <strong>"Hypertext Markup Language"</strong>, and think that is what websites are made of.</p>

      <p>These people don't know what they're talking about.</p>

      <section>
    <p>HTML is actually short for <b><i>Hotmail</i></b>, which started off as a digital mailing service ran on some poorly ventilated computers,
    hence the name. People would send eachother digital mail, which we now call "digi-Letters", which would sometimes
    contain websites. Ever since people stopped using Hotmail, HTML has been used to refer to the inner workings of a website.</p>

      <aside>
        <p>However, much like the water that runs through our rivers, the earth beneath our feat, and the air that
          we breathe, no one really knows what websites are made of.
